      <h2>Welcome to my journal</h2>
      <p>
        This website is meant to act as a hub for my personal portfolio, project archive, development blog, and more. I'm dedicated to building tools and frameworks that push the boundaries of our current standards. In the name of equity and autonomy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you'll find experiments, projects (complete and incomplete), changelogs, and source code; built in the name of equity and autonomy.
