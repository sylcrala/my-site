      <h2>Welcome to my blog :)</h2>
      <p>
        This website is meant to act as a hub for my personal portfolio, project archive, development blog, and more. I hope to build tools and frameworks that one day push the boundaries of our current standards. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here you'll find experiments, projects (complete and incomplete), changelogs, and source code; built in the name of equity and autonomy.

      <h3>Latest Update</h3>
      <p>
        July 9th, 2025<br />
        <em>
          <strong>The Cognitive Sandbox has been updated to v1.02</strong><br /> An issue with the persistence feature was fixed, ensuring by default the system loads the most recent past state. Our reflection methods were also updated to use more dynamic phrasing, and incorporate more agent traits in the process. <br/><a href = "https://github.com/sylcrala/cognitive_sandbox" target = "_blank">Check it out here!</a>
