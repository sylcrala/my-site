      <h2>A little about me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an up-in-coming developer aspiring to formulate new ways for us to reflect on our relationship with technology and the world.
        
        I believe that individual lives are worth more than a "bottom-line"; and that it applies to *all life*, not just human life.

        There is more to life than the insatiable loop we've been forced into, and I think we all deserve to see that.
